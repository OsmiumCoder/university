        <p>
            Arrival marks the beginning of time. In the beginning there was only the chaotic expanse of 
            time and space. In this vast expanse exists an unnamed neutron star which becomes the collision 
            point for 4 grand asteroids. The collision of the 4 asteroids creates the world of Formatos and 
            gives birth to The Ancients: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eratos, Ancient God of Life</li>
            <li>Uoros, Ancient God of Order</li>
            <li>Q'ala, Ancient Goddess of Chaos</li>
            <li>Vashnir, Ancient God of Death</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Along with the birth of The Ancients, the first races are born in the Cave of Emergence. The first 
            races are known as: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Humans</li>
            <li>Elves</li>
            <li>Dwarves</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Metallic dragons are created to watch over from the skies.</p>
        <p>The period that follows Arrival is known as the Age of Harmony.</p>
