        <h1>Waazalwu</h1>
        <p>
            The Waazalwu is a minor event occurring a few years after Departure. The Waazalwu begins 
            with a violent earthquake. From this earthquake the 2 major islands, Ilora and Sithica, 
            emerge from the sea. The Isles of Escalos also appear during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            These landmasses upon being discovered are also found to be inhabited already. New races 
            also emerge. The island of Ilora contains two races known as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vedalken</li>
            <li>Ilorian</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The island of Sithica contains new races and subraces, known as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verdan</li>
            <li>Deep Gnomes</li>
            <li>Duergar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Isles of Escalos also contains new races, known as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tortles</li>
            <li>Yuan-ti</li>
            <li>Locathah</li>
            <li>Grung</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Waazalwu also causes slight mutations amongst humans across the realm. Theses mutations 
            are especially prevalent amongst the people of Drin. This new mutated race becomes known as the Krin.
