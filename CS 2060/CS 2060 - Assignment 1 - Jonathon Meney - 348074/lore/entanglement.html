        <h1>The Entanglement</h1>
        <p>
            The Entanglement becomes the starting point for the darkest age of humanity, though there 
            is a journey we must first take, which follows the The Septenary. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This journey first begins with the gathering of The Septenary in the ancient temple in the 
            Talmachia High Peaks. During this gathering they utilize The Agerterium to attempt to locate 
            the Cave of Emergence, in order to destroy The Null Seal. The Septenary knew the power the 
            seal held and decided no person should ever be able to wield such power nor tamper with such a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Successful in their gathering they travel to a distant land as a group with no others, transporting 
            The Agerterium for use at the Cave of Emergence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon there arrival they are met by Great Wyrm, Edox, Watcher of the Cave. What was discussed between 
            them is known to no one and forever lost to time. Edox, Watcher of the Cave, however, agrees to assist 
            The Septenary and they begin a ritual which will forever alter the course of time and space.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ritual begins with a shifting of the Ley Lines beneath the earth, something that had never been done 
            before. Utilizing The Agerterium, The Septenary were able to shift the Ley Lines and align them towards 
            The Null Seal. As a result of the aligning magic levels spiked across the realm inexplicably. This aligning 
            and spike in magic caused mutations among some individuals creating new races, they become known as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changelings</li>
            <li>Shifters</li>
            <li>Kalashtars</li>
            <li>Simic Hybrids </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now that the Ley Lines have been aligned Edox, Watcher of the Cave sacrifices himself to give The Septenary 
            a reserve of dragon blood, which he explains will be a needed component given the power a dragons blood holds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Septenary gather around The Null Seal and begin the ritual pouring dragon blood around The Null Seal 
            creating a sigil. The Septenary begin chanting incantations and suddenly seem to be overtaken, as part of 
            the ritual, and a void opens in the center of The Null Seal. Tremors begin across the entire realm. The 
            void in which opens is a direct portal to The Null Zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this void emerges 4 marbles which resemble the 4 meteors which created the world. A 5th marble then 
            emerges resembling the neutron star. The 4 others then encircle the 5th closing in and coming with in a 
            hair's distance. 12 more marbles then appear in groups of 3 on each side. Each group of 3 branches from 1 
            of the 4 meteor marbles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Septenary now begin spinning around the sigil and begin multiplying until 12 exist. Each body is then 
            sucked into a marble. These 12 marbles mark the birth and embodiment of The Exalted:

                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The giant corpse of Edox, Watcher of the Cave also disintegrates into a wispy golden soul splitting into the 4 core marbles. These 4 marbles mark the embodiment of The Ancients.</p>
        <p>The transfer of souls and the birth of The Exalted marks the official beginning of The Collapse.</p>
