        <p>
            The Age of Harmony is a short era of just 50 years. During this time hundreds of dragons 
            roamed the lands as protectors. Only small settlements exist at this time and no major 
            cities have been founded yet.
        </p>
        <p>During this period, 3 more races develop, known as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Half-Elves</li>
            <li>Halflings</li>
            <li>Gnomes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Age of Harmony is concluded by the Discrepancy Wars.</p>
