        <h1>The Collapse</h1>
        <p>
            The Collapse remains a brief period in the grand scheme of history lasting somewhere between 
            3 and 5 years. Many of the lands become ravaged during this time and many records are destroyed 
            in the conflicts between the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            This era is a time of war amongst all gods. The Ancients had been the only divine power in the 
            whole realm since the dawn of time and locked themselves behind The Null Seal in The Null Zone 
            knowing the power their conflicts held upon the material plane. In the birth of the 12 Exalted gods 
            the balance of the universe becomes offset. The Ancients understood this must not remain for too long 
            or the world would rip apart from the imbalance of the cosmic forces. The Ancients begin a wave of 
            campaigns to thwart the existence of The Exalted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many cities are hit very hard by some attacks, and mass amounts of population are lost among all 
            civilizations. During this time the skies are sheathed in a blanket of thick darkness. A great age of 
            ideas and information is lost in such a short period never to be recovered again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The remaining Great Wyrms protect as much of civilization as possible. Though many lives are still lost. 
            Without the aid of The Septenary the capital cities suffer heavy damage though most survive from the 
            collective rally of the oldest and wisest mages present.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many tremors also shake the earth during this time, and flooding occurs in low lying areas. Other natural 
            disaster occurs throughout the realm at this time as well. <u><strong><em>These earthquakes and tremors also 
            cause more landmasses beyond the core 7 countries to rise from the seas.</em></strong></u>
            </p>
        <p>
            As a result of The Entanglement ritual The Null Zone remains opened, which allows access to planar travel, 
            causing more races to leak into the realm during this period. The first that appear are those from the 
            <em>Feywild</em>, known as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bugbears</li>
            <li>Centaurs</li>
            <li>Eladrin</li>
            <li>Fairies</li>
            <li>Goblins</li>
            <li>Hobgoblins</li>
            <li>Harengon</li>
            <li>Owlin</li>
            <li>Satyrs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The next races to appear are created by the conflicts of the gods, known as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orcs</li>
            <li>Half-orcs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The next race to appear is brought into existence by the exalted gods of chaos and death, known as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tieflings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last races to appear during the collapse cross over into the realm from the <em>Shadowfell</em>, known as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kenku</li>
            <li>Shadar-kai</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The end of The Collapse is known as the Departure a ritual performed by The Ancients marking a new age 
            of humanity creating the most historic event in history.
