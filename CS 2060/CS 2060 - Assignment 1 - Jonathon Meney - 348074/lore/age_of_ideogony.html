        <h1>Age of Ideogony</h1>
        <p>The Age of Ideogony is the most known time period of all time lasting approximately 700 years.</p>
        <p>
            The official beginning of the Age of Ideogony begins with the construction of the great temple 
            in the Talmachia High Peaks, still standing to this today as the oldest place in the realm. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://dndsrd.net/epicSpells.html">10th, 11th, and 12th level spells</a> exist during 
            this time and allow for great magical feats. These high level spells become known as the 
            <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Epic_magic">Epic Magics</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power of the these <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Epic_magic">Epic Magics</a> 
            allows great mages to arise, and the founding of the great capital cities of the 7 countries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon the founding of the 7 great capital cities, mages collectively agree to appoint a Grand Magus 
            to each city allowing only them to have the power to cast 
            <a href="http://dndsrd.net/epicSpells.html">10th, 11th, and 12th level spells</a>. 
            The appointment of these mages occurs approximately 350 years into the Age of Ideogony.
        </p>
        <p>The 7 Grand Magus' become known as the The Septenary. This council is formed by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alerick, Grand Magus of Kaminar</li>
            <li>Argurus, Grand Magus of Aramoor</li>
            <li>Dourgrin, Grand Magus of Drin</li>
            <li>Ekthar, Grand Magus of Wildrinar</li>
            <li>Ronin, Grand Magus of Kwejian</li>
            <li>Sylvan, Grand Magus of Lyundra</li>
            <li>Tibahn, Grand Magus of Talmachia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Septenary's greatest creation becomes known as The Agerterium, a device able to tap into the Ley 
            Lines deep beneath the earth for energy and magic enhancing capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>The Age of Ideogony comes to an end in one of the greatest disasters of time itself, The Entanglement.</p>
