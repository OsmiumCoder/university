        <h1>Discrepancy Wars</h1>
        <p>
            The Discrepancy Wars begin when a group of nomads return to the Cave of Emergence where 
            they find The Null Seal. The nomads, a group containing one of each of the races, manage 
            to tamper with The Null Seal releasing chromatic dragons into the world. The nomads become 
            known as The Discrepancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The actions of The Discrepancy begins the 30 year war between the races of humanity and the 
            dragons. The chromatic dragons first began lighting settlements ablaze, and begin killing the 
            Metallic dragons. The metallic dragons had been the protectors of humanity since the dawn of 
            time and in turn humanity allied with them through the war.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the war almost all metallic dragons are killed and only 4 remain in the end after 
            the last chromatic dragon is slain, and The Discrepancy is defeated. The 4 remaining metallic 
            dragons become known as the The Great Wyrms, and include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edox, Watcher of the Cave</li>
            <li>Algor, The Skywatcher</li>
            <li>Alzon, The Silvered One</li>
            <li>Edifix, Keeper of Brass.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The killing of the final chromatic dragon and The Discrepancy causes an event known as Severance.</p>
