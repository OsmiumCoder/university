        <h1>Departure</h1>
        <p>
            Departure begins at the birthplace of The Collapse at the ritual of The Septenary in the Cave 
            of Emergence. The Ancients decide that the battlegrounds of their conflicts should not happen on 
            the world of their own creation. As a result, they begin the departure ritual.
        </p>
        <p>The Ancients gather around the perimeter of The Null Seal, and begin to chant:</p>
        <p>
            "Just enough life." Three marbles appear in front of Eratos, Ancient God of Life.
            "Just enough death." Three marbles appear in front of Vashnir, Ancient God of Death.
            "Just enough order." Three marbles appear in front of Uoros, Ancient God of Order.
            "Just enough chaos." Three marbles appear in front of Q'ala, Ancient Goddess of Chaos.
            "All in balance." The Ancients say this in unison. Each of them transforming into a marble. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each marble now blinks and shoots towards The Agerterium still contained above The Null Seal. It 
            begins to pulse. A streak of light brighter than the sun shoots into the sky. Then below into the 
            The Null Zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The light shooting into the sky begins to glow brighter pulsing every few seconds. One pulse for 
            each god. Any gods causing terror, vanish, now held within The Agerterium. Once each god is contained 
            both lights above and below stop. Then with a  vicious ferocity both lights shoot out much wider now. 
            The Null Zone is sealed and the light below stops. The light above now grows stronger. Suddenly the 
            light above shoots out in a projectile fashion The Agerterium following, much slower.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the light and The Agerterium reach the upper atmosphere. Each stops. The light splits into 4 
            lights. The 4 each spit out 3 more lights. The Agerterium begins to free fall.
        </p>
        <p>A few moments pass.</p>
        <p>
            The Agerterium returns, impacting The Null Seal. The lights in the atmosphere. A bright flash. A beam 
            is shot down to the planet. Explosion. The Agerterium, The Null Seal, the only way to The Null Zone, and 
            the Cave of Emergence, destroyed. A shock wave is sent across the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The blanket of darkness is lifted from the skies. 4 moons now orbit the planet, Eratos, Uoros, Q'ala, 
            and Vashnir.
        </p>
        <p>
            The balance of the cosmos is restored. The Ancients depart from the planet, along with The Exalted. The 
            Ancients now live on as the 4 moons, and the formless existence of The Ancients and The Exalted return to 
            The Null Zone unable to ever return for the rest of eternity.
