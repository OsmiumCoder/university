        Hello and welcome to my website full of useful D&amp;D resources for all your needs.
    </h2>

    <div style="margin: auto; width: 50%;">
        <p>This site is comprised of 4 sections for you to explore:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Maps</li>
            <li>Tables</li>
            <li>Lore</li>
            <li>Character Maker</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Maps</h3>
        <p>
            The Maps section contains various maps that you can use in your very own D&amp;D campaign
            if you so choose. All maps that are found on the page were hand drawn by me. Some were made
            over the course of a few hours while some took weeks of planning to get just right. The maps
            page will also give a bit of lore about each location or world.
        </p>

        <h3>Tables</h3>
        <p>
            The Tables section contains various tables that you can use while both running or planning a 
            D&amp;D session. A random encounter table which can be used if you need a quick unique encounter 
            to throw at the party is available. There is also tables that can be used to create names for 
            NPC's, or to generate random loot for the party. As my recommendation I suggest letting the players 
            roll the dice for these tables. Sometimes you can mix it up and roll them your self but its always 
            fun to see your players roll their demise.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Lore</h3>
        <p>
            The Lore section contains various snippets of lore that I have created over time for the maps
            that I have drawn. This lore that I have written is quite extensive for some areas and took
            many weeks and months to create. If you would like to add any of the lore that I have created
            to your own world please feel free.
        </p>

        <h3>Character Maker</h3>
        <p>
            The Character Maker section, and the final section of this site is a simple form that you can
            fill out to keep track of a player character in your D&amp;D game. This feature is great for both
            the players and the DM, as the players can use it to keep track of their character, or the DM can
            keep track of everyone elses player.
