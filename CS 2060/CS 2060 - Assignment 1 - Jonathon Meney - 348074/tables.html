        This section contains various tables that you can use while both running or planning a 
        D&amp;D session. A random encounter table which can be used if you need a quick unique encounter 
        to throw at the party is available. There is also tables that can be used to create names for 
        NPC's, or to generate random loot for the party. As my recommendation, I suggest letting the players 
        roll the dice for these tables. Sometimes you can mix it up and roll them your self but it's always 
        fun to see your players roll their demise.
