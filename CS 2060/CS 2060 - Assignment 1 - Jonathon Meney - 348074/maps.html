        This section contains various maps that you can use in your very own D&amp;D campaign
        if you so choose. All maps found on this page were hand drawn by me. Some were made
        over the course of a few hours while some took weeks of planning to get just right. This
        page will also give a bit of lore about each location or world.

            <p>
                This map was one of the first official maps I ever drew. The world itself is known as
                Tuvern. The world has a rich history and very diverse cultures across its lands. In this
                map we see the 7 core countries along with the most predominant islands and isle in the
                realm. The names are:

            <p>Here's a lore snippet about Tuvern:</p>
            <blockquote>
                The realm of Tuvern forms from Severance when blood of the dragons falls to Formatos 
                forming the waters that separate the lands into the original 7 countries: 
                Kaminar, Drin, Wildrinar, Kwejian, Talmachia, Aramoor, and Lyundra. The 2 islands of 
                Tuvern, Ilora and Sithica, appear much later during the Waazalwu. The Isles of Escalos 
                also appear at this time.

            <p>
                This map is a scaled version of Tuvern. It displays the Canandor Region of The Crescent
                Grasslands. This region is the long southern peninsula. It is a grassy coast filled with 
                many farms. There is also a few large forests and some mountains to the north east. Many small 
                unmarked Hamlets and Thorps dot the coast.
            </p>
            <p>
                The circle with dot at the southern most tip denotes a City (5000-25000 pop.). Squares represent
                Towns (901-5000 pop.). Triangles denote Villages (401-900 pop.). The dashed lines between them 
                all shows the most travelled paths.

                This map is my most recently finished map and I consider it to be my magnum opus. This map is a
                world map for a planet called Driskar. The land is deeply ravaged by craters from fallen asteroids 
                and comets, most notably Xorina and Qonor. Duunir is the oldest landmass on the planet, and is
                where the royal governing house lives, the Driskarian Empire. Xorina once used to be a volcano, but
                collapsed after an asteroid crashed into the mouth of it. Naznador is also as old as Duunir. Overtime,
                the land has become fractured and moved apart. Lastly, Qonor is not natural to the planet, instead it 
                is the aftermath of a supermassive asteroid colliding with the planet millions of years ago before
                civilization began.

                This map is a region map for a region called the Osmos Coast. This map is not of any area on the previous
                world maps. This map was simply a spur of the moment drawing and in truth I have no use for it. If you would
                like to use this map, or any of the other maps, your self please feel free to do so. This map was a practice 
                map I drew just out of fun and I encourage you to do the same. Beginning with even just a simple coast shape
                can lead to many interesting lands.
            </p>
            <p>
                This map was my first time using a border, map title, and a legend. Maps can be simple or complex its completely
                up to you. Experiment by using different techniques if you decide to draw your own maps. Using different symbols
                or map styles can make for very unique and interesting maps.

            <p>
                This dungeon map was the first map I have ever drawn. Its a simple dungeon with one direct path to the end. In my version
                of the map it is filled with many encounters but I think it best I leave them out here as its more fun to fill a dungeon 
                with the creatures found in your world. Below the map is an index of what <em>can</em> be found in the dungeon. As always feel free
                to change what your players may find instead.

                <li>
                    The room seems to be made by humans and is very old in nature. The room is large in size and has multiple 
                    torch sconces placed around the room. There are 2 hallways, one to the north and one to the east.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As you enter the room it seems as though the room was intended for resting with a fire pit in the center 
                    of the room. However it seems like the room was turned into a vault as many empty chests (7) line the 
                    border of the room as well as the bunks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room is rather simple with a few barrels in it. Perhaps a few enemies can be found within. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room is much larger than the previous and some furs hang on the walls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the small area in the west side of the room are 2 Chests (Locked) (DC 17 and DC 22) and 2 Urns are
                    packed away in the corner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room contains a moose and as you watch the moose he is eating a bowl of walnuts and is passive to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As you enter this room you find yourself at a forge as well as a grindstone. Players may choose to upgrade 
                    their weapons here. Sharpening will grant +2 for next 2 combat rounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another simple room which appears to be once used as a working area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The room appears to be have been used as a prison at some point with cells lining the walls. The key to c is 
                    hung on the wall.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room seemed to serve as a crossroads for the dungeon. There is a hall to the east which leads into a small 
                    room, a hall to the north which veers to the west, and a hall to the west which gives off a faint glow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room seems to have been used for a common room for food and drink. Tables and chairs line the room. Perhaps 
                    another good room for an encounter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the most part you can tell that this room was used for cooking, however, the floor and table tops are filled 
                    with books, some are cookbooks while others appear to be lore books. This would be a good place to hide spell 
                    books or scrolls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As you enter this room you realize this is the largest room you have been to so far. In this room I recommend placing
                    a final boss type encounter and after it award a dagger. The dagger seems very ancient and has an engraved handle on 
                    the pommel is a large red crystal (Investigation DC 11. If succeeded they find that the crystal seems like it would 
                    refract light like a focusing crystal).
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room is a fair size and has a few barrels and two ornate chests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This room contains a circular altar in the middle of the room. Upon further investigation of the altar you see that 
                    light shines directly on it and has a small opening in the center and resembles the shape of diamond. The dagger from
                    room 13 fits into it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is another fair sized room which doesn't contain much. Perhaps a good loot room.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The key to the door in room 8 can be found on the other side of the room. This room also contains a plaque. (When 
                    read a large golem will be animated by the magical presence).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Pulling on one of the torches will cause a secret door to open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This door has a trap on it which if opened will cause a fire breathing statue to activate. In order to spot 
                    the trap it requires detect magic or a perception check (DC 16). The cone of fire is 30 ft. has a Dexterity 
                    saving throw (DC 13) 12 dmg if failed, half if success. Dispel Magic can be used to 
                    destroy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As the adventures delve into the hallway they come across a door which seems fairly reinforced. (If they smash 
                    the door down (DC 20) Strength check. The key can also be found in room 9.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can only be unlocked by a key Found in room 17.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a door as well as a button beside which opens the door as well as door f.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This secret door can only be opened by button e or an investigation check (DC 25).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Located in this room is a gravestone. As the players approach the script it reads “Here Lies X.” Where X is someone
                    of your choosing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After placing the dagger in the altar a wall will slowly move down and reveal a set of shelves with items on them. 
                    Within the center is a large radiating crystal.
