        <p>
            Here you will be able to find a few pages. The public characters will display characters which others
            have made, and allowed to be seen by anyone. If you would like to make a character yourself sign up or login
            and you will gain access to the character maker. The characters you create will also be saved in the 
            Your Characters section, which will be visible once you login.
