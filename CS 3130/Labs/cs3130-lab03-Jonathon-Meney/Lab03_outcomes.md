# Lab 03 Outcomes

- greater understanding of how some of the business logic for our app will work
- familiarity with an API (jService)
  - using `http get`
  - parsing JSON
    - practice with Maps
  - converting JSON to dart class objects
- use of Futures and async / await
  - Futures: relatively easy to understand but tricky to use at first
- software engineering practice
  - use of small interfaces
  - exception handling and error throwing
  - factory constructors (fromJSON)

## Motivation

(why am I excited about this lab)

- get to see some results related to the app
  - random questions created from internet dataset
  - the game becomes more easily imaginable
- first opportunities to improve the app
  - get rid of duplicate answers (maybe use a set?)
  - clean up text responses from the API
